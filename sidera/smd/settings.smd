set color filter, choose between 
   *RANDOM_COLOR_SEED     (just a random color)
    BARYCENTRIC_DISTANCE, (in pc)
    TEFF,                 (effective temperature in K, the stars are represented in a kelvin scale)
    LOGG,                 (surface gravity)
   *FEH,                  (metallicity: magnitude of atoms of Fe / magnitude of atoms of H)
   *ALPHAFE,              (magnitude of alpha particles / magnitude of atoms of Fe)
   *AGE,                  (in billions of years)
   *MASS,                 (in solar masses)
    RADIUS,               (in solar radiuses, mean value for pulsating stars)
    VSINI                 (rotational velocity in km/s)
    
STR1024   ^^ 1    !! color_filter    --> FEH    *** writes at COLOR_FILTER_FLAGS and COLOR_FILTER_TYPE



    GRAPHICS SETTINGS



view mode, choose between:
    CARTESIAN, (values are plotted in a xyz coordinates system)
    POLAR      (values are projected in a spherical environment, xyz parameter types are respectevely interpreted as right ascension, declination, and distance)

STR1024   ^^ 1    !! view_mode     --> POLAR    ***



choose between (to compare each pipeline's speed, see the profiling.smd file)
    PIXEL,     (fastest, each celestial body is a pixel)
    CIRCLE,    (fast, each celestial body is represented as a circle)
    CLOUD,     (expensive, each star is represented as a star-looking cloudy object, there's no volumetric rendering btw)
    ANIMATED   (most expensive, each star is represented as a star-looking animated object)

STR1024   ^^ 1    !! shade_type    --> PIXEL    ***
