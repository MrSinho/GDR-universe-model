# Sidera

A 3d representation of the Gaia (Early) Data Release 3 Universe Model data uploaded by the European Space Agency (see [Gaia mission](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia)).

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Compatible_with_C%2b%2b-3CFADC?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2b%2b&logoColor=white&labelColor=0AD0DF#.svg)

@note _This is a pre-release version, first release is expected to be available by the end of **August 2024**._

Programs and libraries are frequently being tested on Windows 11 and Linux Mint (WSL and physical machine) with different compilers (MSVC, gcc), and hardware configurations (RX580 4GB GDDR5, Radeon V Carrizo 500MB).

## Features

 * 3d plot customization using `.smd` files, see [`settings.smd`](./gaia-universe-model/smd/settings.smd).
 * After downloading Gaia Universe Model data, load as many celestial bodies as you need in the scene, see [`settings.smd`](./gaia-universe-model/smd/settings.smd).
 * Decide what parameters to read (`xyz` parameter types + color_filter). To find what parameters are compatible, see [`settings.smd`](./gaia-universe-model/smd/settings.smd).
 * Graphics settings options: view modes (cartesian, polar), shade types (pixel, circle, cloud, animated cloud), see [`settings.smd`](./gaia-universe-model/smd/settings.smd). 
 * Easily add new graphics features using the [`Vulkan API`](https://www.vulkan.org/) through [`shvulkan`](https://github.com/mrsinho/shvulkan)

## Gaia Early Data Release 3 credits

> This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia ([https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia)), processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, [https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium)). Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement.

## Sidera License

Sidera relies on the Gnu General Public License v3 (GPL3), see [_github.com/mrsinho/sidera/blob/main/LICENSE_](https://github.com/mrsinho/sidera/blob/main/LICENSE) for more detailed information.

## Roadmap

### Documentation, references and website
 * Write header documentation
 * Summarize the theory behind each supported parameter (new page)
 * Add commands to documentation
 * Add image or gif to github project
 * Write and link documentation for gaia-archive-tools
 * Add a gallery page

### Graphics
 * Lens flares, bloom effect
 * Brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, HDR (maybe on shengine and not on sidera directly)

### User interface
 * GUI hint to edit ../../smd/settings.smd
 * Add profiling info to gui
 * Add black background regions to gui
 * Customize UI text color and UI regions color

### Serialization/parsing
 * Save or load operation inverts camera rotation
 * Edit stars brightness and more graphics parameters instead of locking them into the shader

### Missing features
 * Screenshots (need to work on shengine)
 * Time simulation based on radial velocity
 * Display vector of radial velocity
 * Motion simulation based on gravity (experimental, embed shphysics to shengine)
 * For cartesian graph use orthographic projection instead of perspective
 * Option for panorama mode and different panorama projections
 * Add orthosphere and planetarium mode
 * Display galactic center and probe location
 * Display polar and cartesian grid and text on grid (see gaiasky)
 * Display constellation and constellation boundaries
 * Option for galactic, elliptic, equatorial and recursive grid
 * Option for distance fade effect

### Datasets
 * Dataset manager app like in gaiasky (flutter could be a possible API)
 * Find interstellar matter / nebulae datasets


### Releases
 * Shci tests before August 2024 release
 * New and modern shinstaller (dismiss python application in favour of dart probably)
 * GDR3 update (first add/improve all the previous features)
